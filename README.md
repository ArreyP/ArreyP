What My 25 Years of Data Experience Truly Means.

With 25 years of data experience, I have a rare blend of deep technical expertise, cross-sector insight, and ethical leadership, shaped by a front-row seat to the evolving data landscape.

Strategic Depth & Evolutionary Perspective
I've witnessed and adapted to the evolution of data practices: from traditional relational databases to today's cloud-native, big data ecosystems. This means I don’t just know tools; I understand the "why" and "when" behind them, which is invaluable for organisations looking to make future-proof decisions.

Cross-Sector, Real-World Impact
Working in both the public sector (e.g., NHS and the DWP) and private sector (e.g., Ericsson and Vodafone) has given me a unique vantage point on regulatory, operational, and technological challenges. I’m not just technically competent; I understand context and business impact, especially in high-stakes environments like healthcare, telecommunications, social welfare, and employment.

Full Lifecycle Project Expertise
From data extraction (ERP, CRM, cloud) to transformation and analysis, I've handled 5 data projects (2 full data migration lifecycles, 3 launch projects). This positions me as someone who can see the whole picture and bridge the gap between raw data and strategic insights.

Ethical Foundation & Research-Led Thinking
My commitment to informed support and ethical practice underlines a rare integrity in my approach, especially vital in an era of rising AI adoption, data privacy concerns, and transparency mandates. My ethical stance shows maturity and leadership.

Mastery of Soft & Hard Skills
Few professionals balance strategic thinking, analytical reasoning, and technical fluency like I do. My toolbox includes:
• Data modeling, ETL/ELT, governance, and security
• Languages like SQL, Python, and tools like Excel and visualisation platforms
• Proven analytical methods grounded in research and real-world impact

Industry Acumen & Leadership Potential
With a quarter-century of insight, my experience is not just operational, it's strategic. I understand how data drives business transformation, making me a potential advisor, mentor, or data leader who can guide teams, set policies, and drive innovation.
